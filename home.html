           	   	  	  		Hello, my name is Arion Kryeziu i come from Suhareka.
                            When i was kid i always wanted to study Computer Science,
                            so this is why i finished the High School studying Infromatics or IT. When i joined the High School i liked this direction.
                            After this my mind was fully completed to keep studying something about computers, networks etc.
                            So now i joined Universum College to study Computer Science and im so happy for the work that we do there.

                          <h3>The definition of Computer Science</h3>
                          <p>Computer science is the study of algorithmic processes and computational machines.[1][2] As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms, computation and information to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software.[3][4] Computer science addresses any computational problems, especially information processes, such as control, communication, perception, learning, and intelligence.[5][6][7]

Its fields can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines. For example, the theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them, while computer graphics and computational geometry emphasize more specific applications. Algorithmics have been called the heart of computer science.[8] Programming language theory considers approaches to the description of computational processes, while computer programming involves the use of them to create complex systems. Computer architecture describes construction of computer components and computer-controlled equipment. Artificial intelligence aims to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.[9][5] Unlike other computing paradigms, computer scientists are focused on academic research.</p>


              <h3>What "Gamer" actually means.</h3>
              <p>A gamer is a person who plays interactive games, especially video games, tabletop role-playing games, and skill-based card games, and who plays for usually long periods of time. Some gamers are competitive, meaning that they compete in some games for money. In some countries, such as the UK and Australia, the term "gaming" can refer to legalized gambling, which can take both traditional and digital forms, through online gambling. There are many different gamer communities around the world. Since the advent of the Internet, many communities take the form of Internet forums or YouTube or Twitch virtual communities, as well as in-person social clubs. Originally a hobby, it has evolved into a profession for some. In April 2020, researchers found that top gamers shared the same mental toughness as olympian athletes.[1][2]</p>
